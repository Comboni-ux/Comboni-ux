# Hey there 👋

I'm Comboni, an Economics senior who got hooked on data analytics after watching Moneyball.

Turns out, using data to make better decisions is exactly what I want to do. I started small–tracking stats for the amateur soccer team I managed, finding patterns that actually helped us win more games. Now I'm building a portfolio of real-world projects to tackle bigger problems.

I'm graduating in May 2026 and am actively seeking my first role as a Data Analyst or Business Analyst.

## What I Work With

- Excel (pivot tables, dashboards, the works)  
- SQL, Tableau, R, Stata  
- Currently learning Power BI, Python's next on the list

## Projects You'll Find Here

**Personal Spending Analysis** - 4 years of purchase data revealing where my money actually goes  
**Remittance Tracker** - Understanding my remittances expenditure habits

More coming as I build them. Everything here is real work on real problems.

## Random Facts

⚽ Big soccer fan and like being a leader!  
🎬 Movies? I like movies where smart characters outthink the system, and the plan makes sense at the end.
